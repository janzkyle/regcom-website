Only the regular PE subjects are available to those who are not part of any varsity team and they should get that PE. If it turns out that they were not able to enlist in a regular PE and mistakenly enlisted in a varsity class PE, then the problem can be fixed during the start of manual enlistment.

Even if you enlist for these classes, you will not be overloaded and you will be able to complete the enlistment process. On the other hand, juniors, seniors, and superseniors who still have to enlist in NSTP, PE, or INTAC will have these courses added to their academic load.
